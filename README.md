## Who Should Read This Book

This book is relevant to a broader audience than just who this book was specifically written for.

This book was specifically written for **game designers**, and **game developers** who create physical games — such as board games, and card games, etc.
And of course this book is written relevant to them.

But, broadly speaking, there are 2 (other) groups of people who I think *could* benefit from reading this book:…

№1: **entrepreneurs**, **people at startups**, **people who create and develop products & services**. This includes **people in Tech** — or **I.T.** for those outside of Canada, and the U.S.

№2: **(electronic) video game designers**, **(electronic) video game developers**.

Of course, there are some parts of the book that are a bit outdated.
And there are some parts of the book that are very very specific to making physical games (such as board games, card games, etc).

But a lot of it is relevant outside of the designing, and developing of physical games.

And a lot of it is relevant in making products, and services in general (that have nothing to do with games).

At the time I read this book, I am someone who had been in the Tech industry — or I.T. for those living outside of Canada, and the U.S. — for 20 to 25 years, depending on how you count it.
Someone who has been in the (electronic) video game industry a number of times.
And someone who has created a number of startups, and companies.

To me, the way this book describes how physical games are created sounds similar to how Tech startups, and Tech companies are created.

Which is not surprising to me, as developing physical games is just a specific instance of developing products.
