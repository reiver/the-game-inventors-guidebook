“Let’s not fool ourselves. Like it or not, the most common reason people want to get games published is to gratify their egos. Imagine how good it feels to show people a published game and say “I created this.” It’s a way of sharing your imagination with others the same way an author or filmmaker does. In my opinion, this is a perfectly good reason to try to get your game published.”
