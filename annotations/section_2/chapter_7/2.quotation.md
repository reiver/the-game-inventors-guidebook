“I’ve met many successful game inventors, and one characteristic I see again and again is the inability to stop thinking of ideas. If you’ve got this kind of drive you almost have no choice but to go into game inventing. “I think about new games constantly,” says Brian Hersch, inventor of Taboo. “In the car, in meetings, it never stops.” ”

“When asked about the most important traits for being a good game designer in his discovergames.com interview, Reiner Knizia replies “You maybe have to be a little bit mad. Games are never out of my head. I am constantly thinking ‘is this a topic for a game?’” Reiner usually has about 100 games at once in various stages of completion and in his head.”

“Mike Fitzgerald, designer of Wyvern and Mystery Rummy, has it too. “My mind can’t sit still. There’s never a time when my brain isn’t working on something,” he admits.”

“If you’re lucky (or unlucky) enough to be one of the few people with Game Inventor’s Curse, you probably already have several games in your head or on paper. Take heart. You’re in good company.”
