“Designing games is a long learning process. You need to get experience by playing lots of different games, talking to people who make and play games, and studying the product lines of companies. I’ve done games for 35 years and I’m still learning all the time. I still understand very little about what makes a game successful. You can look back on past products and do marketing analysis for explanations of why a game was successful or not. That’s all very nice, but it’s irrelevant to understanding what’s going to succeed in the future.”
