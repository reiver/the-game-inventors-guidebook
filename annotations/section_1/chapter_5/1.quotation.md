“Different people expect different things from games. You need to know the audience you’re creating the game for. Do they want an easy game with very fast rules for the mass market or a deep strategic game for experienced game players? It’s important to remember that in the end all that counts is the quality of the game. But the quality criteria change — they are defined by the market.”
