“Kids like to collect things and they like to master knowledge. Look at kids who know all the names of various dinosaurs. If you’re a kid it’s pretty powerful to know something your parents don’t even know. Now Pokemon comes along and there’s a ton of information [a kid] can learn about. You can learn [a Pokemon monster's] names, their powers, how they evolve, it’s a lot of information, but not too much. Now you can know a lot of things that your friends and parents don’t and that’s cool for a kid.”
