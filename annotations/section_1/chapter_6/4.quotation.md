“There’s a difference [in what makes a good game when I see it versus when I play it]. […] [One of the] thing[s] I look for is some kind of a catch-up feature. If I roll all sixes or if I’m the best chess player, you just lose. That’s no fun. There should be a way for someone who’s behind to still have a shot at winning.”
