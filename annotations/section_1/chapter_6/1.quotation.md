“There’s a difference [in what makes a good game when I see it versus when I play it]. As a product acquisition guy there are a bunch of things you have to take into account apart from how well it plays. For example, will it appeal to the target market before they get a chance to play it? Visual appeal is really important. You could design the best game on Earth and if it looked like checkers, people just aren’t going to be drawn to it. There are lots of great games that just look hard and dull - they don’t look alive. They look like work.”

“Remember that if a product gets TV advertising we have 30 seconds to get the idea across and almost all the information there is visual. Plus visual appeal is what people are using to make a judgment when they’re looking at a product in the store.”

“Another thing to look for is a gimmick […] It might be a randomizer, a mechanism, something that shoots out maybe, as long as it’s relevant to the game. Maybe it’s some kind of moving parts, like a donkey that kicks or a car that makes noises, something to give the product some life. Sometimes we see that and say ‘Wow, that’s awesome!’ ”
