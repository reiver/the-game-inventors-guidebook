“There’s a difference [in what makes a good game when I see it versus when I play it]. As a product acquisition guy there are a bunch of things you have to take into account apart from how well it plays. For example, will it appeal to the target market before they get a chance to play it? Visual appeal is really important. You could design the best game on Earth and if it looked like checkers, people just aren’t going to be drawn to it. There are lots of great games that just look hard and dull - they don’t look alive. They look like work.”
