“There’s a difference [in what makes a good game when I see it versus when I play it]. […] [One of the things I look for when I play it is…] It should have a little bit of luck. Luck provides some suspense. With luck you don’t have complete control over the game so there are always surprises. Luck also tends to broaden the age range of players. No luck means the game is solely dependent on thinking. You have to throw your whole mental self into it if there’s no randomness. Most people want to play a game to relax. They don’t want a game that’s like ‘Hey, let’s take a test!’ ”
