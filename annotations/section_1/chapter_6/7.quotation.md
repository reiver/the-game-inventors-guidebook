“A big problem is when you [the game designer] fall in love with your own idea so you no longer have an objective view of it. […] Novices will design a game for themselves - something they want to play. […] if you want to make money you have to sell a lot of them. So there had better be a lot of ‘you’ around to buy them. Otherwise you need to learn to design for other kinds of people. Other ages especially. […] The first thing you need to do is figure out who it’s for.”
