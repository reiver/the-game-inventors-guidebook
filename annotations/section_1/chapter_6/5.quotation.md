“Unfortunately, good games don’t always sell. There are good games that bomb. There are lots of reasons why. It might have terrible packaging, a bad theme, an awful TV commercial, there might be similar games that are just better, it might come out too late for the buying seasons, or it might be too expensive. All things beyond the inventor’s control.”
