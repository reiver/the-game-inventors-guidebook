“There’s a difference [in what makes a good game when I see it versus when I play it]. […] [Some of the things I look for when I play it are…] It has to be easy to get into. It can’t be the same as something I’ve played before. It has to be fun and challenging. It should be competitive. It should have a little bit of luck. […] Another thing I look for is some kind of a catch-up feature. […] There should be a way for someone who’s behind to still have a shot at winning. […] The game shouldn’t be too complicated, too long, and it shouldn’t be too hard to figure out what to do.”
